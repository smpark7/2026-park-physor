In this paper, we present Moltres and its neutronics and thermal–hydraulics modeling capabilities relevant to multiphysics reactor analysis. As a MOOSE-based application, Moltres provides various multiphysics coupling schemes and time-stepping methods, including fully coupled solves with implicit time-stepping. We veriﬁed Moltres’ MSR modeling capabilities against a multiphysics numerical benchmark developed for software dedicated to modeling fast-spectrum MSRs. The results show that Moltres performed comparably to participating software packages in the benchmark; the majority of the relevant quantities fell within one standard deviation of the benchmark average. Among the participating multiphysics tools in the benchmark, Moltres agrees closest to the multiphysics tool from the Delft University of Technology due to similarities in the numerical solution techniques and meshing schemes.},

	abstract = {Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) are advanced reactors noted for strong passive safety features. They present unique challenges in multiphysics reactor modeling \& simulation arising from strong temperature reactivity feedback, delayed neutron precursor flow, and turbulent heat transport in fuel salt regions. Simulating the complex multiphysics interactions in MSRs requires robust, flexible, and highly scalable multiphysics software. Many MSR designs also still retain control rods which can complicate time-dependent reactivity-initiated transient simulations on reactor software relying on neutron diffusion theory. This work builds on existing capabilities in Moltres, a MOOSE-based MSR simulation software, to tackle these challenges and support efforts towards MSR deployment.

This work verified and validated existing multiphysics coupling capabilities in Moltres in two comparative studies. In both studies, Moltres showed good agreement with other MSR simulation tools involving coupled neutronics and thermal-hydraulics problems. This work also introduces a turbulence model in Moltres to support future MSR analyses involving turbulent delayed neutron precursor and temperature transport. Lastly, this work introduces a novel hybrid SN-diffusion method for accurate control rod modeling in time-dependent MSR simulations. The hybrid method combines the strengths of both approaches by generating transport corrections using the SN method near control rods. The SN and neutron diffusion solvers are coupled through an adaptive boundary coupling algorithm. This algorithm allows the solver to adapt to the transport correction parameters and preserve smooth neutron flux gradients across the interface. In 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D k-eigenvalue simulations, the hybrid method produced accurate control rod worth estimates, relative to reference neutron transport solutions and experimental data, at approximately four times the computational cost of the neutron diffusion method. The hybrid method also performed well in a time-dependent rod drop simulation by reproducing expected trends observed in experimental data. Analysis of its computational performance indicated the possibility of further optimizations beyond its current implementation. With the hybrid method’s spatial resolution and efficient computational performance, Moltres could enable accurate and cost-effective simulations of asymmetric transients in MSRs.},

	abstract = {This work presents neutronics models of a small and large fast-spectrum molten chloride-salt reactor. The models are similar to designs being pursued by industry, and they may serve as generic preconceptual and simplified neutronics models that provide information for decision making in licensing-related areas. The two models were created using Serpent, a Monte Carlo neutron transport code, and Moltres, a neutron diffusion core simulator tool. Specifically, this study focused on exploring the applicability of diffusion theory to fast molten salt reactor (MSR) models, the capabilities of an open-source, MSR-oriented simulation tool (Moltres), and optimal energy-group structures. The proposed two-step method involves group-constant generation with Serpent and a multigroup diffusion solution by Moltres. Three energy-group structures were applied. The accuracy of the solutions was determined through comparisons between the two-step and Monte Carlo flux and multiplication factor solutions. The findings indicated diffusion theory captures neutronics with minimal error for the large MSR and yielded best results with the 27-group structure. The 27-group structure yielded an average group flux error below 2\% and keff agreement between diffusion and transport solutions within 30 pcm. The accuracy of the two-step method decreased for the very small (high-leakage) fast chloride MSR, but the neutronics were captured acceptably well with the 33-group structure. In addition to exploring the capabilities of Moltres, this work contributes to the sparse literature involving open-source models of fast-spectrum MSRs. Future work is noted as expanding the capabilities of the neutronics models to incorporate thermal hydraulics.},

Mirroring the physical test beds currently under construction (i.e., Demonstration and Operation of Microreactor Experiments, known as DOME, and Laboratory for Operating and Testing in the United States, known as LOTUS), the Virtual Test Bed was launched by the National Reactor Innovation Center in collaboration with the Nuclear Energy Advanced Modeling and Simulation (NEAMS) program to support the advanced reactor community. This collaborative effort, which involves multiple teams at both Idaho National Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory, aims to use state-of-the-art simulation tools to model a wide range of reactor designs. These models are automatically tested to ensure their continued functionality as the tools are further developed. Examples are extensively documented, each acting as a tutorial for applying the relevant NEAMS tools to that reactor design. Currently, five advanced reactor types (with a total of 12 specific design subvariants) are simulated by a variety of models. These models range from steady-state, core multiphysics simulations to integrated plant analysis during loss-of-flow transients. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly available library of multiphysics advanced reactor models distributed with extensive documentation and maintained through continuous integration.},

	abstract = {Interest in circulating fuel reactors (CFRs), particularly molten salt reactors (MSRs) of the fluid fuel type, has been growing in the last two decades. Starting with a resurgence of interest in Europe, there have been a growing number of methods proposed and codes developed to model the kinetics of CFRs, which is a capability essential to the design and evaluation of such reactors. This work first reviews the physical phenomena unique to CFRs in light of current research and how CFR kinetics are impacted by these considerations. In general, it is found that the movement of delayed neutron precursors (DNPs) through the primary loop has significant impacts on transients at low reactor powers or those with significant spatial components such as a change in the primary loop mass flow rate. Effects on the neutron flux are exceedingly minimal and entirely negligible. An extensive review of published models and methods for simulating CFR kinetics is presented, along with transient simulations in fast and thermal neutron flux systems using representative codes from each of the main modeling categories. Comparisons among methods are presented as are recommendations for their use or nonuse in various transient and work-flow scenarios. In general, it is recommended that time-resolved, multigroup neutron diffusion approaches be used to establish ranges of applicability for point reactor kinetics (PRK)–based approaches that themselves may not be applicable for all modeling situations. In such cases, it is suggested that quasi-static approaches be used where PRK-based approaches cannot be used. Finally, a review of common assumptions used in these models is presented, along with an evaluation of their impact on model performance. It is found that neglecting turbulent diffusion in open core–type CFRs is a poor assumption that leads to an underestimation of the reduction of the delayed neutron fraction. Additionally, it is seen that exclusion of secondary heat transfer loops in models leads to underestimation of transient peaks and troughs.},

	abstract = {At present, no clear guidelines exist for modeling non-water-cooled small modular reactors (SMRs) despite the rising need for high-fidelity simulation tools to support regulators and the industry. Most SMR concepts currently under the Canadian prelicensing review adopted non-water-cooled–reactor technologies [molten salt reactor (MSR), gas-cooled reactor, and liquid metal–cooled reactor] that are new for Canada. There is a need for a modeling tool set that is broadly applicable for the assessment of advanced technologies used in SMRs. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can be used in performance evaluation and safety analysis of non-water-cooled SMRs for modeling three-dimensional (3-D) fluid flow and heat transfer in geometries of arbitrary complexity without resorting to geometry-specific empirical correlations. This study investigates the capabilities of existing models within a commercial CFD code to simulate the flow and heat transfer characteristics in a MSR configuration. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) configuration was simulated in this study using a stand-alone CFD approach, and CFD predictions were assessed with ORNL data. Intricate geometry details within the MSRE core were included in the computational model to study the associated geometric effects. The results obtained in this study showcased the ability of CFD to predict 3-D effects within the computational domain especially at the lower plenums. The predicted trends for the temperature rise in the fuel and moderator within the core were in good agreement with the ORNL data. The results presented in this paper constitute the first step in developing Canadian Nuclear Laboratories’ capability for CFD modeling of non-water SMRs.},

	abstract = {New multiphysics coupling capabilities for molten salt reactor (MSR) analysis have been developed in the Virtual Environment for Reactor Applications (VERA). This development consisted of two main efforts. First, a generic species transport module was added in the CTF code, which is the thermal-hydraulics (TH) code for VERA. This module uses the velocity fields for which CTF solves during the TH calculation to transport species through the core and around the primary loop. Additionally, a gas sparging model has been added to CTF to model the movement of certain species, namely, fission products such as xenon gas, to transport between the molten salt and gas bubbles present in the salt. The second effort in this development was coupling this capability to VERA’s neutron transport code MPACT. This effort focused on coupling the detailed TH transport models in CTF to MPACT to account for feedback effects in the neutron transport calculations. Finally, the thermochemistry code Thermochimica has also been coupled to VERA. Thermochimica performs pointwise calculations for chemical potential and Gibbs free energy and determines what phases are produced by the temperature, pressure, and elemental concentrations at different locations in the primary loop. These capabilities are demonstrated using a model of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE). This reactor operated at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1960s, providing sources of experimental data that were used to develop the model. Various combinations of species were modeled using VERA’s new multiphysics coupling capabilities. Species distributions and reactivity effects behaved as expected for the MSRE model, demonstrating that the coupling is behaving correctly and causing appropriate feedback. The results of these calculations show the potential for VERA to be used for a wide variety of MSR analyses.},

	abstract = {Numerical simulation has been an intrinsic part of nuclear engineering research since its inception. In recent years a transition is occurring toward predictive, first-principle-based tools such as computational fluid dynamics. Even with the advent of petascale computing, however, such tools still have significant limitations. In the present work some of these issues, and in particular the presence of massive multiscale separation, are discussed, as well as some of the research conducted to mitigate them. Petascale simulations at high fidelity (large eddy simulation/direct numerical simulation) were conducted with the massively parallel spectral element code Nek5000 on a series of representative problems. These simulations shed light on the requirements of several types of simulation: (1) axial flow around fuel rods, with particular attention to wall effects; (2) natural convection in the primary vessel; and (3) flow in a rod bundle in the presence of spacing devices. The focus of the work presented here is on the lessons learned and the requirements to perform these simulations at exascale. Additional physical insight gained from these simulations is also emphasized.},
